# Simple Dynasm example

Hi there. I created this 'project' for no other reason than to show off my
mastery of the absolute basics of dynasm. There is literally nothing else
to see here, no new ideas or algorithms or whatever :-).

## How to run

Make sure you have lua installed, as well as the
[BitOp module](http://bitop.luajit.org/). Then, just run make to build.
